## Introduction

The Java Chess Game Application is a personal project aimed at creating a feature-rich chess game with a user-friendly interface. It implements essential chess mechanics, such as legal moves, turn switching, check and checkmate detection, and more. This project serves as both a demonstration of my programming expertise and a base for further enhancements.


## Features

The Java Chess Game Application includes the following features:

1. **User Interface Design**: Create an intuitive and visually appealing UI using Java Swing.
2. **Game Logic Implementation**: Handle chess rules, including legal moves, turn switching, check, and checkmate conditions.
3. **Interactive Chessboard**: Dynamically update piece positions and board layout in response to player actions.
4. **Advanced Gameplay Features**:
   - Highlight legal moves for selected pieces.
   - Implement a reset option to restart the game.
   - Provide real-time feedback for check and checkmate states.


## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **Java Swing**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **Object Oriented-Programming**: To design and structure the game logic efficiently.

## Getting Started

To explore or modify this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GN-SR/JavaChessGame.git
    cd JavaChessGame
    ```
2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
   - Make sure you have the latest version of Java installed (Java 8 or higher is recommended).
   - Use an IDE of your choice (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) for an optimal development experience.

## Installation

1. **Open the Project in Your IDE**: 
   Open the cloned repository in your preferred IDE.
   
2. **Compile and Run**: 
   Build the project, compile the code, and run the application to see the chess game in action.

3. **Run with Command Line (Optional)**:
    ```bash
    javac src/*.java
    java src.ChessGameGUI
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- **Play a Chess Game**: Move pieces by clicking on them and selecting a valid destination.
- **Highlight Legal Moves**: Click on a piece to see all possible moves.
- **Reset the Game**: Use the reset button to start a new game anytime.
- **Check and Checkmate Feedback**: Receive real-time notifications when a check or checkmate occurs.

This game can be played in a local, turn-based mode. It does not support network play or AI opponents at this stage.
